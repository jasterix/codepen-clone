# About this Project

Follow along with Kyle over at [webdev simplified]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcVxX7lu2d4&t=415s))

Quick intro on creating a codepen clone with React. Was deciding between using React or Vanilla JS for [this](https://github.com/jasterix/runner) WIP project. Right now I'm thinking JS over React but that may be due to the challenges with specific packages used

#### Pros of this approach
- Relatively quick and easy to do
- liked the use of local storage

#### Cons of this approach
- CodeMirror was a pain to find/install. It looks like the maintainers abandaon CodeMirror2 in favor of 6?? Still not clear, but that took too much energy for a project I wanted to complete in 1 day
- also didn't like how much was being handled by external tools. I know that's what packages are for, but this pretty much worked out of the box
- react has changed A TON since I seriously used it (in 209). I know web tech evolves quickly but wow did I feel out of place
- more time in the vid was spent on design vs logic (based my preferences)

Even with so many cons, this project was pretty enjoyable. Kyle is a great teacher. It was clearly meant to be a quick little project with a simple approach. In that aspect, he succeeded

#### Verdict
In terms of ultimately understanding how to create a code runner, I'm not sure how helpful this was

## The usual react stuff

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
